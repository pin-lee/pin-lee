# <center>About Me</center>

## Bio 

I'm B "Pin" Lee, a self-taught computer programmer and Computer Science student.

I have a passion for learning, and I am always happy to learn new skills and technologies. 
I believe in leveraging powerful technologies to engineer clean, performant, maintainable solutions.

I'm interested in systems programming and the creation of cohesive embedded systems that utilize 
mathematical algorithms and models, such as behavior-based systems and machine learning, to help people.

I typically build general applications to serve the communities of which I am a part of.
I am a moderator of the [Raspberry Pie Discord server](https://discord.gg/HRPsqw3bpF), the largest
Raspberry Pi<sup>1</sup> community on Discord.

I also enjoy participating in game jams and other such community programming events.
